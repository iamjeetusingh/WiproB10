IP address:
------------

Class A
-----------
	0.0.0.0 - 127.0.0.0
	
	0.0.0.0 	-> invalid range (now used by cloud)
	127.0.0.0	-> testing / loopback IP address
	
	
	1.0.0.0 - 126.0.0.0		--> usable class A address
	
Reserverd IP addresses
-----------------------
Class A		-->		10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255		-> private IP address
Class B		-->		172.16.0.0 - 172.16.255.255		-> private IP address
Class C		-->		192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255	-> private IP address


APIPA IP address	-->  169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
	APIPA 
		- Automatic Private IP Addressing
		- it is assigned automatically, when DHCP does not allocate the IP.
			- DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
			
Task 1 : list at least 20 commonly used port numbers
		- HTTP		-	80
		- HTTPS		-	443
		- SSH		-	22
		- DHCP		-	67, 68
		- DNS		-	53
		- RDP		-	3389
		- SMTP		-	25
		- POP3		-	110
		- FTP		-	20, 21
		- MYSQL		-	3306
		
Task 2 : difference between on-premises and cloud

Task 3 : difference between router and switch

Task 4 : difference between Layer 2 switch and Layer 3 switch

Server
---------
- to monitor, to manage or upgrade the server (DELL/HPE), we need interfaces like:
	- HPE	-	iLO (integrated Lights-out)
	- DELL	-	iDrac (integrated Dell Remote Access Controller)
	- Intel	-	IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface)
	
Server Form Factors
--------------------
	- it refers to the size, shape and design of a server.
	- different type are:
		- Blade server
		- Rack Server
		- Tower server

Server Events
--------------
- these are the system genereated notification or logs
- these helps admin to:
	- monitor 
	- troubleshoot
	- maintenance
- types of server events:
	- hardware events		- genereated by CPU, memory, hdd, power
	- Power events			- unexpected power off
	- thermal events		- overheating
	- boot events			- events gen during boot time
	- OS events				- reboot, kernel panic
	- security events		- login attempts, breaches
	- network events		- link down, IP conflict, NIC fail
	- storage events		- disk failure

Basics of Storage
------------------
- Primary storage
	- directly accessible by the CPU.
	- its fast, but temporary.
	- like:
		- RAM, 
		- Cache Memory 
			- L1 Cache, 
			- L2 Cache, 
			- L3 Cache
- secondary storage
	- long-term storage
	- like:
		- Hard disk (HDD)
			- it has movable parts
		- Solid State Drive (SSD)
			- it does not have movable parts
		- CD/DVD
		
- archival storage
	- long term storage
	- like 
		- tape drive
		- cloud archives
		
- DAS
	- Direct Attached Storage
	- here storage is connected directly to the server/PC.
		- USB, HDD, Flash drive
	- no network sharing

- NAS
	- Network Attached Storage
	- a storage unit attached/connected to the whole network.
	- this storage is accessible onto different computers/server at the same time.
	- file-level storage over LAN
	- ex:
		- NFS
			- Network File Sharing
			- for sharing data within similar OS (W-W & L-L)
		- Samba
			- for sharing data between various OSs (W-L)
	- its is not preferred in enterprise, because it does not provide redundancy.		
	

- SAN
	- Storage Area Network
	- its high speed solution for enterprise
	- because it provides redundancy
	- it uses fibre-optics channel
	
Server and Client operating system
-----------------------------------
Server OS
	- the job is to serve to the client
	- server serves the request based on the need.
	-	ex:
		- DHCP server
		- DNS server
	- Windows servers
		- Windows Server NT		(depricated)
		- Windows Server 2003	(depricated)
		- Windows Server 2008	(depricated)
		- Windows Server 2008R2	(depricated)
		- Windows Server 2012	(depricated)
		- Windows Server 2012R2	(depricated)
		- Windows Server 2016
		- Windows Server 2019
		- Windows Server 2022
		- Windows Server 2025
	
Client OS
	- the job is to request services from server
	- client has very limited permission
	- Windows Client OS:
		- Windows XP
		- Windows Vista
		- Windows 7
		- Windows 8.0
		- Windows 8.1
		- Windows 10
		- Windows 11
		

Assign IP address to server/client OS:
	- Manual / Static IP 
	- Automatic / Dynamic IP (DHCP)
	- APIPA
		- to resolve, check DHCP is working or not.
		- assign static/manual IP address


File system
------------
- file system is a data structure used by an operating system to:
	- organize
	- store
	- retrieve
	- manage data
- components of file system
	- files			- container for the data.
	- directory		- container for the file and directories
	- inodes		- metadata about the file.
	- blocks		- basic unit of storage allocation
- file systems of windows
	- FAT, FAT32, exFAT, NTFS, ReFS
- file systems of linux
	- EXT, EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, XFS, BRTFS, CRAMFS...
	
Storage types:
-----------------
- basic disk
	- non-expandable disks
	- you cannot increase or decrease the size of the hard disk.
- dynamic disk
	- these are expandable disks
	- by attaching more disks, we can increase the size of disks
	- dynamic disks are of 3 types:
		- spanned volume
		- mirror volume
		- stripped volume
- MBR 
	- Master Boot Record
	- its the older way to partition the HDD.
	- the size of MBR is 512bytes
	- Allows upto maximum "4 primary partitions" only.
		- Primary partition 
			- are the partitions that can hold the operating system in it.
		- Extended partition 
			- are the partitions that cannot hold the OS.
			- they are just used for extending the partitions
			- you can create more logical partition within one extended partition
	- it supports only upto "2TB of HDD" size.
	
- GPT
	- GUID (Globally Unique IDentifier) partition table
	- it supports 128 primary partitions
	- it supports upto 9.4ZB 
		1ZB = 1,000,000,000 GBs
	- the size of GPT is 512 bytes.
	- GPT is a production-level solution

- storage spaces
	- storage spaces allow a user to merge two or more disks together and utilize the whole.
	- this is a concept of "Windows" 10/11 or servers OS.
	- in linux, similar concept is know by the name "LVM".
	- in storage spaces, we can instantly plug and play more disks when required.

- RAID
	- Redundant Array of Independent Disks
	- we merge multiple disks (all must be of identical sizes) to get the redundant data
	- if in case the disk crashes, data can be still recovered.
	- RAID is of different categories
		- RAID 0	-	Stripping
		- RAID 1	-	Mirroring
		- RAID 10	-	Mirroring with Stripping
		- RAID 5	-	Parity
		- RAID 6	-	Dual Parity
- ISCSI
	- Internet Small Computer System Inteface
	- iSCSI lets a computers/server access remote storage over the network as if it was a local HDD only.
	- its a production-level solution
	- its a network storage protocol that uses IP network.
	- components of iSCSI:
		- iSCSI Initiator
			- the client that requests for the storage.
		- iSCSI Target
			- the storage device/server providing the storage to the iSCSI Initiator.
		- LUN
			- Logical Unit Number
			- its a reference numbers
		- Portal
			- uses port 3260 for the communication

Minimum requirements to install Win10 OS:
	- 1GHz processor
	- 1GB RAM (32bit OS), 2GB RAM (64bit OS), 4GB RAM (Recommended)
	- 16GB HDD (32Bit), 32GB HDD (64Bit)
	- DirectX12 for graphics
	
Virtualization:
-----------------
- Virtualization is a tech that allow you to create/run virtual version of:
	- Servers
	- OS
	- Storage
	- Network
- Virtualization ca be achieved using a tool/software called "Hypervisor".
- Hypervisors are of 2 types:
	- Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-matel Hypervisor)
		- does not require additional OS to function.
		- used in the production environments
		- they provide best performance
		- but they require licenses.
		- ex:
			- Microsoft Hyper-V
			- VMWare ESXi
			- Citrix XenServers
			- Proxmox
	- Type 2 Hypervisor	(Guest-Based Hypervisor)
		- operating system is needed. without OS, this HV will not work.
		- useful for testing/home purpose.
		- their performance is not equivalent to Type 1.
		- ex:
			- Microsoft Hyper-V (Windows 10/11 - Enterprise/Pro)
			- VMWare workstation (free)
			- Oracle Virtual Box (free)
			- VMWare player (free)
			- VMWare fusion (Paid - MacOS)
			- Linux KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) (free)
			
- task
	- install the win10/11
	- configure the IP address, Subnet mask, DGW, DNS
	- turn off firewall
	- configure the computer name / hostname
	- take snapshot of this VM
